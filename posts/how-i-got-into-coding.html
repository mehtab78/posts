<h1>Things I Believe: Core Principles That Guide My Life</h1>

<p>Published on December 3, 2024</p>

<p>These are the fundamental beliefs that guide my life, shape my decisions, and influence how I approach work and relationships. They're not commandments carved in stone, but rather principles that have served me well so far.</p>

<h2>On Personal Growth</h2>

<h3>Embrace Continuous Learning</h3>

<p>The moment you think you know everything is the moment you stop growing. I believe in maintaining a beginner's mind regardless of how experienced you become. Technology evolves, people change, and our understanding of the world deepens—if we're open to it.</p>

<p>Some practical ways I implement this:</p>
<p>Read voraciously: At least one technical book and one non-technical book per month</p>
<p>Build side projects: The best way to learn is by doing, even if the project never sees the light of day</p>
<p>Engage with communities: Surround yourself with people smarter than you</p>

<h3>Process Over Outcomes</h3>

<p>Focus on creating systems and habits rather than obsessing over specific outcomes. If you have good processes in place, good outcomes will naturally follow. This applies to everything from coding to fitness to relationships.</p>

<p>"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." — Aristotle</p>

<h2>On Technology</h2>

<h3>Build for Humans, Not Machines</h3>

<p>Software exists to solve human problems. No matter how elegant your code is or how impressive your architecture might be, if it doesn't make someone's life better, it's ultimately worthless.</p>

<h3>Simple Over Clever</h3>

<p>Clever code is fun to write but miserable to maintain. I've learned (sometimes painfully) that simple, readable code is almost always better than clever, optimized code that nobody can understand six months later.</p>

<h3>Ship, Then Iterate</h3>

<p>Perfection is the enemy of progress. I believe in shipping MVPs (Minimum Viable Products), getting real user feedback, and iterating. A good product in users' hands today is better than a perfect product that never ships.</p>

<h2>On Work and Career</h2>

<h3>Value Depth Over Breadth</h3>

<p>In a world that glorifies "full-stack everything," I've found that developing deep expertise in one area makes you more valuable than being superficially knowledgeable about many. Specialization allows you to solve problems that generalists can't.</p>

<h3>Create More Than You Consume</h3>

<p>The internet is filled with content consumers. Be a creator. Write code, write blog posts, create tutorials, contribute to open source. Creating forces you to understand things at a deeper level than consuming ever could.</p>

<h3>Work With People You Admire</h3>

<p>Life is too short to work with people you don't respect or learn from. I prioritize working environments where I'm surrounded by people smarter than me, where I can grow.</p>

<h2>On Life Philosophy</h2>

<h3>Practice Gratitude Daily</h3>

<p>It's easy to focus on what we lack. I make a conscious effort to acknowledge what I have. This simple practice dramatically improves mental well-being and perspective.</p>

<h3>Health Is Non-Negotiable</h3>

<p>You can't optimize your life if you're not optimizing your health. Regular exercise, proper sleep, and good nutrition aren't luxuries—they're prerequisites for doing good work and living a good life.</p>

<h3>Own Your Mistakes</h3>

<p>Everyone makes mistakes. What separates people is how they handle them. I believe in:</p>
<p>1. Acknowledging mistakes immediately</p>
<p>2. Learning from them</p>
<p>3. Implementing systems to prevent repetition</p>
<p>4. Moving forward without excessive guilt</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>These beliefs evolve as I learn and grow. They're not meant to be universal truths, but they've served me well so far. The key is to have principles but remain open to questioning and refining them.</p>

<p>What do you believe in? What principles guide your life and work?</p>
